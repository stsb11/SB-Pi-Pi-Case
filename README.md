# SB-Pi-Pi-Case
SolidWorks Raspberry Pi housing

A set of SolidWorks (2017) parts and an assembly. Uses these parts: 

Raspberry Pi 3
ILI9341 2.4" TFT touch display (from AliExpress)
30mm 5V PC fan
Standard PTM momentary switch
Several M3 machine screws and nuts
Female-female SIL jump wires

Finished housing is 42x95x60mm (HxWxD). Lid stays in place without glue.

Case printed (for me, at least) with no supports on PLA. Once printed, use side-cutters to remove the vertial spars between the USB and network socket holes. 

Attribution: PTM switch and fan models came from free downloads picked up at GrabCAD.com.
